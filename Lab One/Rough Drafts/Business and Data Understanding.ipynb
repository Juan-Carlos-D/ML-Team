    "- The `Hotel Bookings Dataset` contains a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to hotel bookings, cancellations, and guests' details for Resort and City Hotels. From the dataset's description, \"it provides insights into various aspects such as the type of hotel, the number of adults, children, and babies per booking, the length of stay, the meal plan chosen by guests,\" and other features. The travel industry is booming following the COVID restrictions that were in place over the past few years. However, cancellations are inevitable and can negatively impact hotel operations. The provided data in this dataset can facilitate analysis by examining the factors that are likely to lead to a cancellation, such as long lead times, the average daily rate, or even past cancellation behaviors. This dataset aims to identify these trends to predict whether a cancellation will occur or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset contains 119,390 rows and 33 features. The target feature is `is_canceled`, which indicates whether a reservation was canceled or not. Although the methods for acquiring this dataset are not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to infer that it was collected by hotel management systems or third-party booking platforms. The purpose for its collection was likely to assess the factors and trends leading to cancellations in reservations. Cancellations can financially impact hotel operations, especially if they occur last minute, after hotels have already allocated their budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prediction task for this dataset is to predict whether a cancellation will happen or not based on trends or patterns identified in the data. For example, if city hotels experience more cancellations than resort hotels, it could indicate what guests value more in their hotel experiences. Accurate predictions would be beneficial to various stakeholders:\n",
    "    - **Hotel Managers**: They could use the model to minimize revenue loss and optimize operations by adjusting pricing or offering last-minute deals for canceled rooms.\n",
    "    - **Marketing Teams**: Insights from cancellation trends could help marketing departments design campaigns that attract guests less likely to cancel, or improve service offerings to reduce cancellation rates.\n",
    "    - **Local Businesses**: Hotels often operate near popular destinations (e.g., Disneyland or downtown areas), so reducing cancellations ensures more tourists stay, benefiting nearby businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measure of Success\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the prediction algorithm is successful, several criteria should be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: The model should perform significantly better than random chance (50%). A success rate of over 90% would indicate that the model is effective in predicting cancellations, ensuring more reliable business decisions. An accuracy of 90% or higher would help hotels confidently adjust their overbooking strategies, dynamically price rooms, and increase operational efficiency.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Precision and Recall**: \n",
    "   - **Precision**: It is crucial to avoid incorrect predictions of cancellations (false positives) as these could lead to overbooking and customer dissatisfaction. \n",
    "   - **Recall**: Ensuring that most cancellations are correctly predicted (high recall) minimizes unexpected losses due to no-shows. \n",
    "   - A **balanced F1 score** (harmonic mean of precision and recall) would indicate an optimal trade-off between avoiding false positives and false negatives, making the model more practical for real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Impact**: The model needs to be robust and flexible to handle real-world variability. For example, it should accommodate fluctuating booking patterns during peak seasons and varying customer behavior. Additionally, a successful model should help hotels maintain occupancy rates close to industry benchmarks (typically around 70%-80%) by dynamically adjusting prices for canceled rooms or offering last-minute deals to minimize revenue loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Examples and Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overbooking Strategies**: Many hotels rely on predictive models to allow for overbooking, ensuring occupancy rates near 100%. Accurately predicting cancellations enables hotels to avoid losing revenue from empty rooms while preventing too many customers from arriving with insufficient room availability.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Revenue Management**: Accurate cancellation predictions can lead to a 10-15% improvement in overall hotel revenue by optimizing pricing strategies and maximizing room availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency**: By predicting cancellations and adjusting for them in advance, hotels can better allocate their resources, adjust staffing levels, and reduce operational costs. For instance, if a high probability of cancellations is predicted for a particular weekend, hotel management can optimize staff scheduling and avoid overstaffing.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Aggregated Features:**\n",
    "    - `num_of_guests`: This combines `adults`, `children`, and `babies` because the total number of guests is more likely to influence cancellations than each guest type separately.\n",
    "    - `length_of_stay`: This merges `stays_in_weekend_nights` and `stays_in_week_nights` to reflect the total duration of the stay, which is more significant than the specific days of the week.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Individual Attributes:**\n",
    "    - `hotel`: This captures whether the booking is for a resort or city hotel, which is important for understanding cancellation trends across different types of hotels (i.e. vacations vs. business trips).\n",
    "    - `is_repeated_guest`, `previous_cancellations`, `booking_changes`: These provide insights into guest behavior, including past cancellations and modifications, which could predict future cancellations.\n",
    "    - `adr`: The average daily rate paid by guests, which helps reveal if cancellations are more likely at certain price points.\n",
    "    - `deposit_type`: Reflects whether a deposit was made, which is important in determining the likelihood of follow-through on the reservation.\n",
    "    - `lead_time`: The amount of time between booking and arrival, a key factor in understanding guest decision patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes were selected based on their relevance to predicting cancellations and their potential to provide meaningful insights into guest behaviors and booking patterns."

    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with feature aggregation, it’s crucial to ensure data quality by addressing missing and duplicated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Data:\n",
    "- **Identified Issue**: The `children` attribute had 4 missing values out of 119,390 entries. These missing values were likely caused by users leaving the \"number of children\" field blank during the booking process.\n",
    "- **Analysis and Visualization**: To verify this, we visualized missing data using a bar plot, which showed that only the `children` column had missing entries, and the extent of missingness was minimal.\n",
    "- **Justification for Imputation**: Given that there were only 4 missing values and that these likely represent bookings without children, we imputed the missing values with `0`. Since the impact is minor and the missing data represents less than 0.01% of the total entries, this method prevents skewing the dataset without requiring more advanced imputation techniques like KNN, which would be unnecessary for such a small fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Duplicated Data:\n",
    "- **Identified Issue**: We detected 41,787 duplicate entries out of 119,390 total entries (about 35% of the data). \n",
    "- **Potential Causes**: Duplicates may have resulted from merging different systems or accidental/intentional multiple bookings by the same guests.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: We confirmed the presence of duplicates by simply looking at the first 6 entries in the dataset and spotting a duplicate in the 5th and 6th entries.\n",
    "- **Justification for Elimination**: After examining the dataset, we decided to drop all duplicates. The reason for this is to prevent over-representation of certain guests or bookings, which could introduce bias in our model. By removing these 41,787 duplicate entries, we ensure that each entry represents a unique booking instance. After cleaning, we have over 70,000 unique entries, which remains a robust dataset for analysis."
